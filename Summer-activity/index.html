    <h1> Description </h1>
    <p> I mostly helped my mom clean around the house and my room. <br>
        Nothing exciting about that. <br>
        <br> During the summer I joined the
        Intership.<br> Made some friends and connections, I also learned about <br>
        Graphic Design which was really fun and I got paid.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once I would get home from Digital nest Id eat, hangout with my family, shower and sleep. <br>
        Thats how my day went by, it went by super fast during the summer.
